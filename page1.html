                    Week 1</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The first class of the semester went very similarly to last time. A presentation was done wherein each project group was explained and marketed towards the new students. While I did have the opportunity to change group, I opted to stay within Operations Engineering, as I had previously agreed to take on a liaison position with Rob. During the period I introduced myself to the new students and gave them advice on what project group to join. As I had already come in and set up my PC prior, I spent the rest of the lesson helping other students put their computers together and get situated.<br><br>
The second class involved a meeting with Faisal and Rob, going over expectations for the group and laying out a series of tasks that would need to be completed. During this discussion, Faisal informed Jae Bum Joo and myself that we would be taking on leadership positions over this semester. This meant that we'd need to keep up to date with the goings on of the group and making sure that everything was going smoothly. The tasks that were identified for remainder of the semester were; A Cuckoo Security Sandbox, the migration of a help desk, malware reverse engineering, a ticketing system and the transfer of Databases 2 &amp; 3's onto new technology.&nbsp;<br><br>Previously I had worked on the proposal for the Databases transfer, alongside Jae and ex-student Rebekah (Bex) Shinderman, which made it a somewhat obvious task for me to take on. I instead ended up going with the Ticketing System, with my line of thought being that I wanted to branch into new areas and had relatively little experience when it came to managing a website. As project is designed as a simulation of real world working conditions, I thought it best to pick up as many skills as I could, rather than bottlenecking myself into a year long project.&nbsp;<br><br>After the meeting ended I got to clearing out the 'to-do' list from last semester, updated the D312 PC cleanup task, assigned a roster and made sure that everyone knew what the requirements for it were. After this I went around the team and made sure that everyone had a task that they wanted and that there was a relatively even distribution of students across.&nbsp;<br><br>After discussing with Faisal the requirements and needs for the Ticketing System, I began researching a potential solution. Over the weekend I complied a proposal to present to Faisal on Monday, with a few potential options as well as my personal recommendation. That proposal can be seen <a href="assets/files/Ticketing-SystemProposal.pdf" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Here</a>.</p>

                    Week 2<br></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">After a brief discussion with Faisal on Monday, I presented my proposal. We talked over the pricing models and agreed that RT Resource Tracker was the right move going forward, due to previous familiarity the team had working with it. I teamed up with Roynuka (Roy) Nukanuka for the remainder of the Ticketing System job. We'd agreed to construct a resource request detailing what we need and why in order to complete the task at hand. I believed that'd we would be able to have this done by the following Monday and confirmed that date with Faisal.<br><br>Due to a rising Covid-19 alert level within Auckland, it was decided that this class period was going to be done entirely working remotely over a Teams call. This was in order to ensure that in the event we were forced to work from home we'd be able to do so smoothly. At the beginning of the call, Faisal asked each of us to discuss what it is that we were working on and what we were planning going forward. When it came my turn to talk, I found that my microphone was not being picked up by the web-browser. As this was a test for remote working, this was obviously going to be something that I'd need to fix going forward. After downloading the Teams application, I was able to configure my microphone through that, however for the remainder of the meeting I ended up having to communicate via text.<br><br>For the remainder of the class time, I was working on developing the resource request for the RT Resource Tracker, however, Roy was needed elsewhere so he ended up departing after the briefing. I decided to finish up my portion of the report and sent it to Roy, asking if he would be able to get his half of it completed before Sunday so I had time to compile everything prior to our presentation to Faisal.<br><br>Roy would later get in contact with me on Sunday, letting me know that he'd run out of time to finish his portion of the proposal and that he'd try and get something done prior to Project starting on Monday. However, as we were meant to be presenting as soon as the class started, I knew that wasn't going to end up working out. Letting Roy know that I had it covered, I went about completing the report myself, which can be viewed <a href="assets/files/Ticketing-SystemResourceRequest.pdf" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Here</a>.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">After talking it over with Faisal, we agreed on a pricing model that would let us do what we needed without going into unnecessary spendeture. After this, I updated Roy on what had been agreed upon and what we would need to be doing going forward. After digging through Azure, we'd agreed on a virtual machine distribution that would be compatible with all the requirements to run RT Resource Tracker. Unfortunately, we quickly realized that we had yet to be given permission to work within the resource group, presumably due to the fact that our permissions were stripped during the holiday period. After requesting the authorization that we needed through Faisal, we ended up heading home as there was next to nothing we could do at this point in the process as it would take around eight hours for the permission changes to apply.<br><br>During the second shift of the week, I was unable to attend due to family commitments. I kept in touch with the group over Teams and made sure to let Roy know exactly what was going on, in order to not leave my partner high and dry. As a result of this, Roy was left to set up the VM alone. I asked Roy for the login credentials in order to test this out myself, however, I did not end up receiving them until the next week.<br></p>

                    Week 4<br></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I decided to come into project a few hours early in order to sort out the problem with the virtual machine, as it would be a bad look if we were stuck unable to access our VM during class time. After getting the login user from Roy and his copy of the private and public keys, I began attacking the problem. After getting a similar error to Roy, I decided to generate new keys using PuttyGen, which I was able to apply to the virtual machine under the 'Passwords' section of the VM's Azure page. Doing so allowed me to connect via the command line with the command, <strong>ssh -i <private key="" path="" style=""> RT-Admin@20.193.69.242</private></strong>, or directly through Putty.&nbsp;<br><br>Once Roy arrived, we began installing the dependencies required to run RT Resource Tracker. This began with installs of MariaDB and Apache2. Initially, we'd gone with the idea that we were going to run our database on a separate VM, due to a set of requirements we'd read for RT. However, after a bit of discussion, we agreed that it really wasn't necessary at all and only served to inflate our costs needlessly. RT requires a lot of apache2 modules, something that I'd previously had no experience in working with, the process turned out to be barely different to installing any other program, simply being a slightly modified apt get command,&nbsp;<strong>sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fcgid</strong>, for example.<br><br>A major problem that we were running into was that the documentation for RT was hugely out of date, the wiki was a series of dead links and miss-information, as a result of this we spent quite a long period of time attempting to cobble together a strategy that would successfully give us an install. Executing a wget command on the RT GitHub I downloaded the directory and unpacked it onto our VM. RT comes with several commands for an easy instillation, checking dependency errors as well as automatically deploying, however, what we didn't know was the dependencies that we needed in order to be able to run these commands in the first place. This resulted in quite a lot of trial and error as we struggled to get the program to function at all.&nbsp;</p>

                    As we had no classes on Monday, this came out as being a less busy week than previously. After installing the package Xstring, we were able to activate the the RT scripts, allowing us to properly begin on getting the site deployed. We begun with the configure script, which sets up a few preliminary directories for us as well as giving us several options for instillation. Due to a lack of experience working with the program, we did not deviate heavily from the norm at all, and went with a relatively standard instillation. RT has a script which in theory, is meant to check what dependencies that you have and then install whatever you're missing. In practice we found that several packages were simply never installing, however the script itself generated thousands and thousands of lines, making determining exactly what was missing in the automatic instillation process incredibly difficult, as other wise we could simply manually install what was missing.&nbsp;<br><br>On Thursday, I ended up having to leave work early before project as I'd come down sick. I made sure to let Roy know, and worked remotely from home attempting to work on our missing dependencies, however, I was suffering greatly from brain-fog during this time and it was Roy who really came through and found some resources that would help us going forward. I wasn't able to stay with Roy during the whole class period, as I was progressively getting worse and worse, fortunately he was really good about it and assured me not to worry.</p>

                    Due to the recent events in Auckland, in which there was an outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, I decided to go to the doctors to receive a Covid test. Ultimately this resulted in me leaving with a great deal of anti-biotics and instructions to get as much rest as possible. During the week prior, we had created a VM running Ubuntu 20.04, as opposed to our original which was running 18.04 for testing purposes. This was to see if running a more modern version of Ubuntu would help resolve some of our dependency issues that we were running into. Working remotely from home, I attempted to work out what the issue was during my waking hours. Ultimately by using mySQL over MariaDB we were able to get a lot further in regards to the amount of errors remaining. Work during this week was extremely minimal, but I was able to schedule some time off of work for week 7, which would allow me time to cram in order to make up for my sickness period.</p>

                    Returning to campus on Monday, I was working alone as Roy had injured his leg at the gym and was in a physical therapy appointment. The majority of the period was taken up by group meetings to discuss where we were at and how we were going to progress forward. I created a new Virtual Machine, titled RT20.04, my thought process being that we'd gotten a lot further in terms of dependencies and that a fresh start would be ideal for ensuring that we didn't run into messy errors down the line from our experimentation period.&nbsp;<br><br>I opted to ignore the automatic dependency programs that came with RT, deciding that ultimately they were far too much trouble than they were worth. By this point I had managed to piece together exactly what was required, so installing them all manually was fairly trivial. After setting up the database on Maria and manually installing each program, I was finally given the all clear by RT for all dependencies. From where it was simply a matter of configuring Apache to point towards my RT directory and I was able to generate a complete deployment.<br><br>Logging in with default credentials of Root and Password, I was able to access the site fully, however whenever I tried to create something or edit a user, I.E interact with the database, I was given a Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) error. I believed that this was to do with the ip address for RT not being whitelisted for access, thus the system was blocking itself in order to preserve data integrity. Unsure of where to go from here, I began researching a solution.<br><br>RT stores it's configuration files for whitelisting in /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm, once I found this, it was as simple as adding RT20.04's IP address to the list. From here the CSRF error was completely resolved.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">With no class on Monday, I decided to poke around the system a little and familiarize myself with the mechanics of RT Resource Tracker. Going through the permissions for users, I was able to set it so any user created from this point onwards will be able to take, create and edit tickets.<br><br>After we updated Faisal on where we were at with the process, he let us know where we should next be focusing our efforts. The plan is for RT to be able to update users via email whenever a ticket is created in their queue or once it's updated. This allows for users to be consistently up to date with what the group is working on at any one time. Additionally, a DNS is required going forward, this will change the access point for the website from an IP address to a proper URL. Roy and I agreed that I would tackle the email system, while he worked out a DNS.&nbsp;<br><br>Due to the incoming semester break, we elected to prioritize research during the remainder of the week as if we rushed into anything we'd have forgotten by the time we returned to classes in two weeks. Doing research into DNS, we started researching a free (or at least very inexpensive) option. As budget is a major concern, we were trying to avoid going too far.<br><br>For the final period of the semester we had a group discussion where each group listed what it was that they were doing, what they've already done and what they're going to do next. While a lot of groups did get called out, Roy and and myself managed to get through the process cleanly.</p>

As, for some peculiar reason, no one was thrilled by the idea of coming into school on their holidays, I decided to do it myself.

The goal was to replace a motherboard and install 6 SSD's onto the kits students use for PC Maintenance.<br><br>Unfortunately Rob told me that he wasn't exactly sure which kit needed their motherboard replaced, but there would be documentation of it. Going through the records I wasn't able to find anything in relation to a need for a new motherboard. Getting in contact with Rob again, I found out that it was Isaac Thomas who had told him about the motherboard requirement. Giving him a call I found out that in reality he had replaced the motherboard and then told Rob that he had done it, who got confused and thought it was still to be done.&nbsp;<br><br>When I enquired about whether or not I should install windows onto the SSD's or leave it to the students Rob informed me that he hadn't thought of that and that I shouldn't continue until he finds out what Hamish Smith wanted to do with them. In the end I left school three hours later having accomplished nothing.</p></blockquote>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Returning to class for the second half of semester, Jae and myself were approached by Hamish in regards to working with a charity. Com2Tech works to get unneeded computers out to people who need them. As the Polytechnic cycles through a great deal of PC's with the advancement of technology this exists as a perfect opportunity to reduce the load as well as doing some good. Hamish wanted a consistent 3rd year student to run and manage it, with a cycling cast of certificate students showing up to assist. After gathering some notes, I let Hamish know that we'd have a proper response for him by next Wednesday, as we would need time in order to ask around and gauge interest. Jae ultimately wasn't interested in the proposal, so I decided that I would step up and manage the task going forward.&nbsp;<br><br>Hamish approached jae and I in regards to working with a charity com2tech. He discussed how he wants two groups of students working alongside with a representative from the charity.
<br>The work would involve refirbishing old computers which would then be distributed to low income families, schools, etc. After taking some notes during the meeting with him, we let him know we'd 
<br>have a proper response for him by next Wednesday, as we would need time in order to ask around the group to see who was interested. As Jae has a busier schedule than I do currently
<br>I decided that I would take charge and manage this job.&nbsp;<br><br>I brought the issue of DNS up with Rob as well as a few ideas we'd been having. He let me know that the Polytechnic was actually paying for a DNS system through the Azure webservice. While he was currently planning on shutting it down as it wasn't being used, he decided to give Roy and I access to it.&nbsp;<br><br>Working with a DNS is relatively simple, with the site already deployed and accessible via an IP address it was as easy as deciding on a name. I settled on Isaacrt and went about setting it up. While it was working on devices outside of school, I was a bit puzzled as it wasn't working on campus. It turns out that it can take the Polytechnic network to update with changes like this.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Moving on to the Email issue, I was quickly finding a similar problem to the past. There was simply a complete lack of valuable resources. I knew I was going to need an email management system, so I eventually settled on Postfix. While Postfix isn't the most complicated program in the world, there's definitely a great deal if fiddling around required to get it set up and running properly. I decided I would work out a test system first, before attempting to connect Isaacrt to it.<br><br>As Roy was unable to attend class, I opted to stay at home as to not disrupt with an hour of travel necessary to get to school. Finishing up the postfix system, I ended up trialing out a test email which I sent through to my school email address. While it was a success and everything went smoothly, the email was directed to spam, something that obviously wouldn't work in the long term.<br><br>As there had been a relatively solid amount of interest shown from various project members in the charity, I let Hamish know that we would be good to go ahead for next Friday. The position would involve about two hours of work each week, coming in before it started to set up the computers as well as getting all of the equipment that would be needed ready. Thankfully, my place of work is relatively close to school, so I'm able to consistently be in the area at the appropriate time.&nbsp;<br><br>I decided that I would take a look at the computers that we'd be working with in order to get some basic ideas of the kind of work that we'd be doing. The machines ranged between Windows and various Linux distributions, each one with varying degrees of parts. Some machines were good to go right away after a quick memory wipe, however others required a bit of hardware troubleshooting. I let Hamish know that going forward we would need multiple USB's containing Windows 10 ISO's in order to get the job done, something that he assured me would be available by next Friday.<br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I was in regular communication with Hamish at this point, discussing what, when and where in regards to the charity evening. Alongside this I was focused on getting the email system successfully attaching to RT Tracker. RT it self determines when it will email someone through a series of scrips. A few of these come pre-loaded with the system, however they're relatively easy to workout yourself. Because of this, I had to learn the language that RT used in order to make sure we were completely covering our bases.<br><br>I had a brief meeting with Faisal to discuss what groups would be using Isaacrt next semester. Due to the nature of things, it's not as easy as creating a group and populating due to the requirements for changes in the config files to support. Because of this, I wanted to get everything properly laid out early. After creating groups for project and Ops I went through and assigned aliases to their sending and return email address, this allows RT to call them when necessary based on each groups name.&nbsp;<br><br>On Friday at 2:30pm I began setting up for the first Com2Tech meeting. This involved setting up work stations for each RSVP, being three sets of power cables, monitors, mice and keyboards hooked up ready to go. I discussed with Rob about the correct way to use the air compressor and then gathered enough safety equipment for everyone. Meeting with Hamish prior, I was able to get a collection of USB's which he'd set up for Windows 10 instillation.&nbsp;<br><br>Meeting with the Com2Tech representative, Sarah, we went over what it was we'd be doing and how we wanted to go about this in the weeks to come. Three Project members ended up showing up, Isaac and Roy as well as Prasanth Rao from the Mobile Project group. Unfortunately, the USB's supplied by Hamish weren't working. While they did have data for windows on them, they were not configured in a way that you could launch the computer from it in order to install Windows. Because of this we were slightly restricted with what it was that we were able to get done. Because of this we decided that it would be better to check for whatever machines already had a Windows 10 instillation set-up and then simply get those in working order while returning all others to the pile. Because of this we were able to get a lot of computers sorted out, as the fixes necessary were relatively minor, replacing a stick of ram, clearing user data, etc. After the hour had eclipsed, I helped load the completed computers into Sarah's car and returned to clean up and return everything to it's rightful place.</p>

                    Week 12</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Roy ran into what turned out to be a familiar issue this week when attempting to create a ticket. After trying to tinker with it himself he eventually asked me if I knew anything about it. Similarly to when we changed from a local host to a defined IP address the system was blocking out access to the database from the new URL of Isaacrt.op-bit.nz. While our IP addresses were added to the whitelist, this wasn't the case for our new address. Going back over my documentation from weeks previously, I was able to quickly go in and fix the problem relatively quickly. After implementing this change and restarting Apache2 tickets were able to be created again with no issues.<br><br>I asked around the groups again to figure out interest in the reoccurring Friday afternoon Com2Tech charity workshop. Letting Hamish know the potential numbers, I informed him of the problem with our USB's and asked if it would be possible to sort out for the next workshop.&nbsp;<br><br>During this time, my partner on RT Roy was shifting his priorities from a folio and completing RT to passing an Azure certificate exam. Because of this I was now going to be working on the website solo. This meant that I needed to be brought up to date with everything that Roy was currently working on. After I had gotten the DNS sorted, Roy had moved on to working with the SSL for the website ensuring that it was secure to connect to. I got a copy of what he'd tried so far as well as the various resources that he'd been using to accomplish this.&nbsp;<br><br>This time no one came to the charity, meaning it was just myself and Tim, another Com2Tech representative. While three people had shown interest initially, other commitments had come up for them. Ultimately this completely reasonable as this shouldn't be something that exists as priority for them over their actual grades. Working by myself, I was able to test out the new USB's from Hamish. The lack of people around acted as a blessing in disguise as I was able to take my time to figure out how each system needed to be fixed. Because of this in weeks to come I'd be able to let my teammates know exactly what to do should they be stuck at any point during the process. I installed Windows 10 onto 5 different PC's, over writing their Linux operating systems. After configuring them for instant use, keeping in mind the people who receive them will likely not be tech literate, I started working to clean them out and then got them loaded into the car.<br></p>

                    As the end of the semester was coming closer and closer, I decided that it would be best to start focusing on the transfer over to next Semester's work. This, for my position, meant doing a lot of write-ups letting whoever takes over my role know how to do it as well as what work is yet to be done. This means writing up usage guides for Isaacrt as well as instructions for managing the Com2Tech work next semester. I wanted everything to be as precise as possible, to not leave any room for confusion. I opted to start with the Isaacrt write up, as it was over all the larger and more pressing task.<br><br>Hamish wanted to start bringing in certificate students into the Com2Tech charity workshop. The intention with this being that they'll get practical experience working computers in a relatively low risk environment. Additionally, I was to act as a tutor of sorts when going about this work. The idea going forward is that we'd have two to three certificate students each week coming in to work with us.&nbsp;<br><br>We had three students from Project not including myself, and one certificate student come in for the workshop this week. Work went pretty quickly as I updated everyone on how to go about installing Windows. I spent the majority of my time this period assisting Ben, the certificate student who was working along side of us. He did pretty good and gathered the basics real quickly. Ultimately we were able to get 9 machines through, a little less than expected considering the amount of people that were there, but we encountered some incredibly slow installs as well as some pretty disastrous hardware issues.</p>

                    As Roy was now fully off working on Isaacrt, I decided to dedicate my time to getting the SSL working. After digging around in the teams files I was able to find files specific for our DNS op-bit.nz, these being a ca-bundle, crt, key and pem file alongside instructions for how to go about it. In practice however, I found that it wasn't going to be as simple as advertised. Apache's ssl folder is currently considered bad practice by users, the suggestion now is to store them within a different directory, /etc/ssl/certs. From here you would need to then enable SSL within the rt5.conf file within Apache. I was getting an error where the insecure version of the website was working fine while the htttps:// prefix caused it break. After tinkering through I was able to create a dummy page on Apache using the files supplied by Rob for security. This did end up working for a secure site, however I struggled with getting it working on the original. In the end I decided to rewrite the entire rt5.conf file manually, putting in a clause where the insecure version of the site immediately redirects towards the https version. After an hour or two of bug fixing I had it ready to go.<br><br>With this out of the way, I was able to turn my attention completely towards my my Isaacrt write up. I wanted to have instillation instructions included, as this was something we were never able to find when attempting it ourselves. This meant in the rare event that the site did go down or was somehow removed they would be able to quickly build a replacement. The completed write up can be viewed <a href="assets/files/IsaacRT-TicketingSystem.pdf" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Here</a>.<br><br>The topic of backups came up with Rob. We wanted me to ask around the groups and find out what, from what they've been working on, would need to backed up in the future. The goal here being that if we're all using the same backup system it will over all have a much lower cost. I'm to gather this information and then write up a proposal for next semester to work on. This is to go over possible options as well as pricing.&nbsp;<br><br>During the Com2Tech workshop we had 3 project students, Roy, Prasanth and myself, as well as three certificate students there to get some practice in before a test they had coming. I split my time evenly between working on refitting the old PC's as well as assisting the certificate students whenever they became stuck on a problem.&nbsp;</p>
